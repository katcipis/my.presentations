* Agenda

- Where did "Object Oriented" come from ?
- Interfaces
- A real use case
- What is the purpose of software design ?


* Origins of Object Orientation

- Every "new" thing usually has more than one influence
- It is hard to pinpoint the origin of an idea
- But people insist on being pedantic =D
- Ranting like "Go is not OO"
- So lets be pedantic too

* Alan Kay on Object Orientation

At Utah sometime after Nov 66 when, influenced by Sketchpad, Simula, 
the design for the ARPAnet, the Burroughs B5000, and my
*background* in *Biology* and *Mathematics* , I thought of an architecture for 
programming.

It was probably in *1967* when someone asked me what I was 
doing, and I said: "It's *object-oriented* programming".


* Alan Kay on Object Orientation

I thought of objects being like *biological* *cells* and/or individual 
computers on a network, only able to *communicate* with *messages*.

The term *"polymorphism"* was imposed much later (I think by Peter Wegner) and 
it isn't quite valid, since it really comes from the nomenclature of 
functions, and I wanted quite a bit more than functions.


* Alan Kay on Object Orientation

I didn't like the way Simula I or Simula 67 did inheritance.
So I decided to leave out inheritance as a built-in 
feature until I understood it better.


* Alan Kay on Object Orientation

I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because
it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The *big* *idea* is *"messaging"*

The Japanese have a small word -- ma -- for "that which
is in between" -- perhaps the nearest English equivalent is "interstitial"

The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its
modules *communicate* rather than what their internal properties and
behaviors should be


* Object Orientation Origin on a Nutshell

- Encapsulation (objects are like cells)
- Messages between objects
- No inheritance
- No polymorphism (it is a subset of the idea)
- Focus on what is between objects, not the form of the objects (morphos/type)


* First Lesson Learned

Giving names ir hard, even for people like Alan Kay =)


* Now when I think about some traditional object oriented languages

* That which is in between: Interfaces


* Example: Reading File (or Stream...or whatever)

* What is in between

* What types matter ?

* Show me the code


* Why is this great ?

- No need for the object implementing an interface to explicit declare it
- The object implementing an interface is also not coupled to which name has been given to a interface (doesn't matter)
- The type (form) of the object implementing an interface is irrelevant
- The focus is on which messages (methods) it implements


* What is the objective of software engineering ?

- There is a lot of challenges, like scaling, correctness, etc
- But one of the main ones is how to accomodate change
- Interfaces helps us accomodate change


* Flexible and Safe

There is no need to design ahead of time which interfaces you
are going to need.

No need to previously extrapolate how your objects will be used.

Interfaces can be added to communicate with pre-existent objects as
the need arises, in ways you did not foreseen, safely.

Changes on a object that breaks a interface is caught
at compile time with a clear error. No runtime surprises.


* Final Lesson

The only requirement for collaboration is a way to communicate
